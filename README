Instructions for using database

Open a new terminal and type the command 'python database.py'

Follow the prompts in the terminal to sign in as a worker (manager or employee) or a customer

If signed in as a manager, user can add, delete, view, or update any table in the database
If signed in as an employee, user can view schedule, wages, and products
If signed in as customer, user can view products and transactions

Alternatively, instead of logging in, user can enter queries for output using database data.
